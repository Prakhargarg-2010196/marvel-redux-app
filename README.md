# Marvel Redux App

## Description

This is a fairly simple project that introduced me to read through the documentation of redux and learn about state management in general. 
I learnt API fetching through building this app using the redux-thunk api and combining it with Marvel API that I used for fetching the comics.

# Things I learned and Features I have implemented as of right now 
- Flexbox 
- Responsive Designing principles like media queries
- Redux Thunk API for fetching and storing data
- Populating the data onto the site
- Introduced Lazy Loading on images of comics
- Hover animations on cards

# Much intended features I would like to introduce in future 
- clicking on card displays information of the comic
- extending the comic functionalities to the characters too
- using of state in some or the form to learn about more features of state management
